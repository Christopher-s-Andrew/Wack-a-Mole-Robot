Wack a Mole Robot


Group Members: Austin Castillo, Christopher Andrew, Xavier Garcia, Sinan Kekic


Project Overview:
We aimed to make a “Wack a Mole” Robot that detects different colored buttons and turns them off
according to which button is lit. We used a PID controller to move the arm to each button location,
Computer vision to detect button colors, and a state machine was implemented to control the flow of
logic.

Project demo explanation: In the demonstration video you can see the robot move to push each color
button as they light up. After the button is pressed a new button is lit up for the robot to detect
through computer vision and seek out and press the button. We let the robot find and push the
random buttons for 2 minutes to demonstrate the robot’s repeatability.
